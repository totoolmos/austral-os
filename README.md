# 🇦🇷 Austral OS - Founders Edition

**Austral OS** is an Argentine-born Linux distribution based on Ubuntu, designed to merge the stability of a Debian-based core with a minimalist, modular, and elegant interface.



## 🚀 Project Vision
The goal is to provide a visually stunning "Glassmorphism" experience. Austral OS breaks away from traditional desktop layouts by utilizing a **Split Horizon** dock system divided into three functional islands: **Command**, **Apps**, and **Status**.

## 🛠 Technical Specifications
* **Base:** Ubuntu 25.10 (Questing Quokka).
* **Desktop Environment:** KDE Plasma (Highly Customized).
* **Visual Engine:** Kvantum for real-time Blur and Transparencies.
* **Architecture:** x86_64.
* **Design Philosophy:** Minimalist aesthetic with a focus on workspace clarity.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Three-Island Dock:** Separate modules for system navigation, active tasks, and system status.
* **Glassmorphism:** Deep blur effects and semi-transparent surfaces across the UI.
* **Native Speed:** Built on the latest Ubuntu kernel for maximum hardware compatibility.

## 🇦🇷 Why "Austral"?
"Austral" refers to the South. We want to show the world that high-quality, beautiful, and functional software is being crafted right here at the southern tip of the globe.

## 🏗 Installation (WIP)
Currently in the **Founders Edition** stage. 
1. Download the ISO.
2. Flash it to a USB drive using BalenaEtcher or Rufus.
3. Boot and enjoy the southern breeze.
